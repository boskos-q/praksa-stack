# Praksa Stack

Simple docker stack for testing interns assignments

## Description

This stack uses PHP8 & MySQL 5.7

## DB Credentials

    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
    MYSQL_DATABASE: symfony
    MYSQL_USER: mysql
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: password

In project, use `mysql` as host for connection to the database instead of `127.0.0.1` e.g.:
`$pdo = new PDO('mysql:dbname=symfony;host=mysql', 'mysql', 'password');`

If you're using some MySQL desktop app e.g. MySQLWorkbenc, Sequel Pro, etc. for host use `127.0.0.1`

## Getting Started

Edit your `hosts` files and add alias for this docker container

`sudo echo '127.0.0.1  dev.praksa.local' >> /etc/hosts`
